//! traitchecker.rs -
//!
//! Trait inference is a part of type inference which determines:
//! 1. Which traits are required for a given Definition to be compiled
//! 2. When a `ast::Variable` is encountered whose Definition has some required traits
//!    whether these traits should be propagated up to be required for the current definition
//!    or whether they should be solved in place instead.
//! 3. Solving trait constraints, yielding the impl that should be used for that specific
//!    constraint and attaching this impl to the relevant callsite variable.
//!
//! The only public function of this module is `resolve_traits`, which is meant to be
//! called when an `ast::Definition` is finishes type inference on its expr rhs. This
//! function will look at all the given `TraitConstraint`s and determine whether each
//! depends on a parameter/return type and should thus be propogated up to the
//! `ast::Definition` as part of its signature, or does not depend on either and should
//! be solved in place instead. Any impl it solves in place it will attach the relevant
//! impl to the `ast::Variable` the TraitConstraint originated from, so that variable
//! has the correct definition to compile during codegen. For any impl it fails to solve,
//! a compile-time error will be issued.
